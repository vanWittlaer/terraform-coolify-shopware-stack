# var/log host bind mount for the WEB app (the one filesystem write left after moving the
# private/public filesystems to S3). monolog's rotating_file handler writes
# prod-<LOG_CHANNEL>.log under var/log; the same host dir is bind-mounted into the
# workers/scheduler service too (workers.tf, via long-form `type: bind`) so all processes
# share it and their logs show up together in the Shopware admin.
#
# Only the web app is a coolify_application_docker_image, so only it uses coolify_storage —
# coolify_storage does NOT attach to service containers (see workers.tf / FINDINGS). Guarded
# by local.log_host_path (derived from log_host_base + environment_name): empty => no bind
# mount, logs stay ephemeral in-container.

# the host path is absent, breaking auth_basic_user_file. The host dir + .htpasswd are
# created out-of-band and chown 82 (same discipline as the var/log dir). Guarded by
# local.basic_auth_host_path (enable_basic_auth + log_host_base): empty => no mount

# Workers + scheduler run as a docker_compose_raw SERVICE (not coolify_application_docker_image)
# because only compose exposes a first-class `entrypoint:` — and these MUST override the
# image's supervisord entrypoint to run a console command instead of the web server (Risk W).
# Mirrors shopware/docker/worker/docker-compose.yml and how rabbitmq/elasticsearch run.
#
# docker_compose_raw must be a CONSTANT string (the provider's validator quirk), so the image
# ref and the full app env are injected as service env vars (coolify_envs_bulk.workers) and
# consumed via `$${APP_IMAGE}` interpolation + `env_file: .env` (Coolify writes the service's
# env vars into that file). Each service gets a distinct LOG_CHANNEL so monolog's per-process
# log files don't clobber.
#
# Shared per-service compose bits (identical across worker-1/2/scheduler; only entrypoint +
# LOG_CHANNEL differ):
#  - stop_signal SIGTERM + stop_grace_period 120s → graceful messenger drain on redeploy
#    (finish the in-flight message before SIGKILL).
#  - long-form `type: bind` var/log mount (source $${LOG_HOST_PATH}) — the long form is what
#    stops Coolify slugifying the source into a managed named volume, so workers share web's
#    var/log and their logs show up in the Shopware admin.
